'''ZZ003.py
a successor to SZ001.py, and ZZ002.py.
(forked off of ZZ002 on April 5, 2024.

Note: ZZ002 already supported for role-spacific visualization.
 It did have a bug, though:  If one user joined 2 or more roles
on the same browser page, then only the vis. for the first of
these chosen roles ever showed up, even though the turn would
change, and the applicable operators were updated ok.

For more information about how roles work, see either external
documentation or comments in ZZ002.py.

TECHNOLOGY:

This program is intended to be run in a Unix (e.g., Linux) environment.
It loads several Python modules including some that are not part of
the standard Python 3 distribution, and so they must be installed
separately:

flask
svgwrite
flask_socketio

This program (originally SZ001.py) was initially a variation 
of app.py (from below)
to which some SOLUZION-like elements were added.

The app.py  example comes from:
https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/easy-websockets-with-flask-and-gevent

This file SZ001.py (as well as the particular problem-formulation file
that is read in) constitute the SERVER part of a client-server system.
The client code is sent by the server, on request, to a browser that
requests it.  The client code normally lives on the server in the "templates"
folder.  It's a Jinja template that is mostly HTML, which gets processed
into a complete HTML5 page when it is served.  Its filename is index.html.
That file includes a certain amount of Javascript, and it also loads in
some Javascript libraries, when run in the browser.  
  
This Javascript code allows it to carry out a long term "conversation"
with the server, never leaving the one web page that the file defines.
The communication between client and server, begins as normal HTTP to
load the page.  However, it immediately afterwards establishes a
web-socket communication channel, which has two advantages over the
more common mode which is Ajax interaction.  One advantage is low
message overhead over the socket: whereas an Ajax transaction has
quite a bit of overhead, a socket message has much less.  The second
advantage is that the server can "push" messages to one or more
clients without the clients explicitly polling for new messages from
the server.  This simplifies the broadcast of state updates in a
multiuser context, when one user makes a change that all other users
in the same session need to see immediately.

To run this, cd into the subdirectory representing a problem formulation
such as RockPaperScissors.  Then type
../ZZ003.py RockPaperScissors
Then point a browser at <hostname>.<domain>:<PORT>
For example:
TEMPURA.CS.WASHINGTON.EDU:5000.

Or use a port number as an additional argument:
../ZZ003.py RockPaperScissors 5432
